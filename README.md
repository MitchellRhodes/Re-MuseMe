# Re-MuseMe


Re:MuseMe is a platform that get's people out of their music genre comfort zone by comparing sub genres and similar undertones of the artist/songs. As a group of music enthusiast we're always on the hunt for new music to listen to, We want to create a place where what music genres and artist you like are truly tailored to you.

Why do we want to create this app?

We want to help people expand their music taste in a way that they normally wouldn't.

Who is the target user? 

Anyone who is passionate about music and want to expand their music taste instead of listening to the same old same old

What are the core features / functionality?

A tinderesk multiple choice between a few songs to see what the user likes so then we can "match" a genre based on genres and sub genres. Creating Playlist that recommend different countries based off if you like a genre that are the same, example "You like pop, you should try EuroPop". User profiles that save your liked genres/songs/artist. User login and authentication

What are your stretch goals for features /  functionality? 

Genre and Artist details pages giving the background and history. Reviews on the artist/genre/song from users, the users will have tags of what genres they like underneath their usernames to let people know where which reviewer is coming from when reviewing about a genre/artist/song so other users are not discouraged to give the genre/artist/song a shot
